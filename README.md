Task: Understanding File Permissions and Applying chmod in Python Context
In this task, I explored the concept of Unix-style file permissions by creating a flowchart to break down how permission strings like rwxrwxr-x are interpreted. Then, I simulated applying these permissions to a Python file using the chmod command.

1. Flowchart: Permission Breakdown
To visually represent how file permissions work, I designed a flowchart with the following logic:
 - Start Node: The flow begins when the user provides a symbolic permission format, such as rwxrwxr-x.
 - Split Permission Groups: The string is divided into three groups:
    - User: rwx
    - Group: rwx
    - Others: r-x
 - Convert to Numeric:
    - Each character is translated into its corresponding numeric value:
       - r (read) = 4
       - w (write) = 2
       - x (execute) = 1
    - The values in each group are summed:
       - User = 4+2+1 = 7
       - Group = 4+2+1 = 7
       - Others = 4+0+1 = 5
 - Resulting Permission: The final permission code is 775.
 - Apply with Command: The user would apply this with chmod 775 filename.py.
 - End Node: The flow ends after permissions are successfully set.
This flowchart helped me understand not just the symbolic form, but also the numeric representation used by the chmod command.


2. Python File: permission_test.py
To simulate the application of permissions, I created a simple Python file with the following line:

print("This is a test Python file for chmod.")

The file is minimal and only exists to act as a target for permission modification. In a real scenario, this file could be made executable with proper permissions using chmod 775.


3. Text File: chmod_simulation.txt
Alongside the Python script, I wrote a text file that documents how chmod 775 works in detail:

 - Command:

chmod 775 permission_test.py

 - Permission Breakdown:
    - Owner (User): rwx → Full access (read, write, execute)
    - Group: rwx → Same full access
    - Others: r-x → Can read and execute, but not write
 - Numeric Values:
    - rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
    - rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
    - r-x = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
This document serves as a reference explaining what the permission string means, why the final numeric value is 775, and how each group of users interacts with the file.

Outcome
Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of how file permissions work in Linux environments and how symbolic permissions (rwx) convert into numeric values (775). The flowchart provided a clear logical path, and the simulation gave me practice applying the concept on actual files. This is a foundational skill, especially when managing executable scripts or collaborative development environments where permission control is essential.
